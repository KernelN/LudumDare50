**Game made for Ludum Dare 50**

# **PLACEHOLDER**

PLACEHOLDER it's a Mini-Game, in which you play the role of a minor wind deity. An artist has been punished by Zeus by making the wind gods use their powers to blow their amphoras to the floor, thus breaking them. Since you felt pity for the punished mortal, you disobeyed the God of the Sky and decided to use your own wind powers to keep the amphora standing for the longest time possible, so as the artist can, for at least a moment, admire his or her work.

This is a game being developed by students from <a href="https://www.imagecampus.edu.ar/">Image Campus</a>
